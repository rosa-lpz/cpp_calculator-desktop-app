# C++ Calculator Desktop App


## Description
This is a simple calculator application built using **C++** and **C++/CLI** with a graphical user interface (GUI). The application was developed in **Visual Studio** and allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The app features a clean and easy-to-use interface for users to input values and perform calculations.

## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **User Interface**: A GUI built with C++/CLI and Windows Forms for an intuitive user experience.
- **Display Area**: Displays the current input and result of the calculation.
- **Buttons**: Buttons for numbers (0-9, arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), decimal point (.) and cleaner (C).
